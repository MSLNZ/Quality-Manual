\bibitem{Metre_convention} Metre Convention (Convention du M\`etre), also known as the Treaty of the Metre, is an international treaty that was signed in Paris on 20 May 1875. The treaty set up an institute for the purpose of coordinating international metrology and for coordinating the development of the metric system. In 1960, the system of units it had established was overhauled and relaunched as the "International System of Units" (SI).
