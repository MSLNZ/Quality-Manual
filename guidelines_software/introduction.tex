\section{Introduction}
MSL relies heavily on software to control experiments and for acquiring, processing and presenting measured data. Most sections develop bespoke solutions that suit their needs. 

The quality system imposes requirements on software used to carry out test and calibration work, but does not set expectations for the quality of the software. To satisfy the quality system, software must demonstrably meet the requirements of the task. This will be verified during validation of a technical procedure. The quality system also requires the integrity of both software and measurement data to be strictly controlled. 

These are rather modest requirements for assets that represent a very significant investment of time to develop and maintain.   Unsurprisingly, problems arising from insufficient maintenance of software are rife within the Laboratory. 

Much MSL software consists of `legacy' programs that are used only occasionally. Specification of requirements, documentation and software testing are often lacking, making maintenance very inefficient. Some sections have invested heavily in types of software that are inherently difficult to maintain at the level required for calibration work: spreadsheets being a good example. Spreadsheets are convenient for quick work, but notorious for hiding errors and renowned for allowing inadvertent changes to creep in.  

That is why this document has been prepared. The intention is to present techniques that can improve the reliability and maintainability of software. While recognising that MSL has substantially different requirements to most commercial and even scientific organisations, and that a variety of software development systems are in use, there are general practices that can improve software quality. There are also useful tools available. 

This guide recommends a structured approach to software development. The objective is not merely to produce an executable application, it is also to provide: a clear statement of design requirements, an explanation of the software design to meet those requirements and a suite of tests that verifies the software's performance against the requirements. It is desirable that any part of a software project can be examined and understood by someone other than the author. This allows re-use of software and facilitates maintenance. 

We recommend that software development be undertaken in active consultation with other members of the technical section, or MSL. As in most quality system activities, the quality of one individual's work will benefit from a review by someone else. Professional developers use regular reviews to both detect errors and improve the quality of a product. These reviews occur throughout the development cycle, not just at the end. MSL software development should do this too.
